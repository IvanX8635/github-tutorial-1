Follow the directions in this [link](https://github.com/hstatsep/ide50)  

**_Why do we need an SSH key?_**
SSH key is used to access your account. We need it because rather than signing in multiple times to enter our account we only have to sign in once. An SSH key is also used to link your local repo to remote repo.
